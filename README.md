# Resources for English Learners

This list of resources is for anyone learning English, but especially if you're learning English with me in Finland. I'll add more links every so often. If you have any suggestions of your own for this list, [let me know](http://www.rawreef.com/).

## All skills
* [Breaking News English](http://www.breakingnewsenglish.com/) - Worksheets with a short article, reading comprehension, vocabulary exercises, discussion questions and a roleplay. Each worksheet comes with an audio recording of the article, so you can practise your pronunciation too.

## Pronunciation
* [Phonetic sounds and symbols](http://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/en/apps/sounds-right) - Find out which sounds are difficult for you. Then watch the videos below for those sounds. 
* [BBC Learning English - Pronunciation Tips videos](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/pron/) - Focus on sounds you're having trouble with. If you're a native Finnish speaker, these are likely to be [ə](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/pron/sounds/vowel_short_5.shtml) [θ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/pron/sounds/con_voiceless_6.shtml) and [ð](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/pron/sounds/con_voiced_6.shtml).

## Listening
See **Penguin Readers** above. Many Penguin Readers come with an audio version of the book on CD, read by an actor at a slower speed than normal, so it's good for learners.
