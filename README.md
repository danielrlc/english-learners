# Resources for English Learners

This list of resources is for anyone learning English, but especially if you're learning English with me in Finland. I'll add more links every so often. If you have any suggestions of your own for this list, [let me know](http://www.rawreef.com/).

## All skills
* [Breaking News English](http://www.breakingnewsenglish.com/) - Worksheets with a short article, reading comprehension, vocabulary exercises, discussion questions and a roleplay. Each worksheet comes with an audio recording of the article, so you can practise your pronunciation too. **(#elementary) #intermediate**
* [Daniel's Quizlet flashcard folders](https://quizlet.com/dowhatdan/folders) You don't need a Quizlet account to practise these flashcards, but if you create an account, you can then easily create your own flashcards, or copy my flashcard sets if you want to edit them or add translations and so on. Note that some of these folders contain flashcard sets which are password-protected. These are just for certain groups I'm teaching (you know who you are). #elementary #intermediate #advanced
  * [Finnish-English sentences](https://quizlet.com/dowhatdan/folders/sentence-translations-english-finnish) #elementary #intermediate
  * [General language practice](https://quizlet.com/dowhatdan/folders/english-with-daniel-general) #elementary #intermediate

## Pronunciation
* [Phonetic sounds and symbols](http://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/en/apps/sounds-right) - Find out which sounds are difficult for you. Then watch the videos below for those sounds. **#elementary #intermediate** 
* [BBC Learning English - Pronunciation Tips videos](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/pron/sounds/) - Focus on sounds you're having trouble with. If you're a native Finnish speaker, these are likely to be: [ə](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/pron/sounds/vowel_short_5.shtml) [θ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/pron/sounds/con_voiceless_6.shtml) and [ð](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/pron/sounds/con_voiced_6.shtml). **#elementary #intermediate**
* [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) - A quick way to check what a word or phrase should sound like. Bear in mind that the voice sounds only about 80% human. Individual words work okay, but phrases sound quite robotic. **#elementary #intermediate**

## Listening
* See **Penguin Readers** above. Many Penguin Readers come with an audio version of the book on CD, read by an actor at a slower speed than normal, so it's good for learners. **#elementary #intermediate**

Here are a couple of my favourites: [For more wonder, rewild the world - George Monbiot](https://www.ted.com/talks/george_monbiot_for_more_wonder_rewild_the_world#t-60121) and [How to escape education's death valley - Ken Robinson](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_how_to_escape_education_s_death_valley) **#intermediate #advanced**
